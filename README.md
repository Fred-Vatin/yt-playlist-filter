> If you add your language, open a [discussion](https://github.com/Fred-Vatin/yt-playlist-filter/discussions) to share the values you added to the script. I will add them in a next release for everyone.


## Automatic Updates

If your extension that handles user scripts is set to auto update, if a new version is available in this GitHub repository, it will update it unless you modified the script.

That’s why I recommend to watch this repository and star ⭐ to easily find this page again in the future.
